## Overview

This repository contains a hypothesis and theory article proposing a mechanistic framework to explain CBD's paradoxical effects—neuroprotection in some cellular contexts, cytotoxicity in others.

### The Central Question

> *How does the same molecule protect neurons while killing cancer cells?*

### The Answer: A Two-Pathway Model

CBD's effects are determined by **dose-dependent target engagement** and **pre-existing mitochondrial status**:

| Pathway | Concentration | Targets | Outcome |
|---------|---------------|---------|---------|
| **Therapeutic** | 1-5 μM | TRPV1, 5-HT1A, PPARγ, GPR55 | Neuroprotection |
| **Cytotoxic** | >10 μM | VDAC1 → Mitochondrial disruption | Apoptosis |

CBD functions as a **mitochondrial stress test**—amplifying the pre-existing state of cellular bioenergetics rather than selectively targeting pathology.

## Key Findings

### Literature Validation
- **90% concordance** (18/20 predictions confirmed) with published literature
- Analysis of **70+ papers** on CBD cellular mechanisms

### Four Validated Predictions

1. **Temporal primacy**: Mitochondrial effects occur within minutes, preceding receptor signaling
2. **Pre-stress sensitization**: Metabolically compromised cells show 3-5× greater CBD sensitivity
3. **VDAC1 dependence**: VDAC1 inhibitors attenuate CBD-induced cytotoxicity
4. **Measurable changes**: Consistent alterations in ΔΨm, ROS, Ca²⁺ flux across studies

### Identified Experimental Gap

No published study tests whether **VDAC1 blockade eliminates CBD's neuroprotective effects**. This represents a critical experiment that could validate or refute the two-pathway model.

## Clinical Implications

If validated, this model suggests:

1. **Therapeutic selectivity** can exploit metabolic vulnerability rather than molecular uniqueness
2. **Biomarker-guided dosing** using mtDNA status, CYP450 variants, tumor metabolic phenotype
3. **Combination therapy rationale** for metabolic sensitization strategies
