**Parameter in question**
Which parameter do you believe needs recalibration? (e.g., Kd_VDAC, scavenging_capacity, g_max)

**Current value in model**
The value currently used and which simulation version it appears in.

**Proposed value or range**
What the parameter should be, based on your evidence.

**Supporting evidence**
Published references, experimental data, or quantitative reasoning supporting the change.

**Expected impact on model output**
How would this change affect the simulation results?
